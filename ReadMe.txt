  Installation:
    To install the scrip you need to create a MySql database
    and enter the database name, host, username, and password
    in the /system/system_config.php. There is also a few other
    settings in the config to setup the url and path.

    Once you've enter a valid database name and credentials you
    can upload the script to your server. When the script is
    accessed it will create the database tables it needs if
    they don't exist, saving you the trouble of importing the
    structure.

    Thats it. You should be able to enjoy the script, as long as
    the config file has valid information.
